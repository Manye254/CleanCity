1. Introduction
This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the "CleanCity: Waste Pickup Scheduler" web application. This application, built with React, simulates a waste management system for African cities (with a focus on a Kenyan context for this project), and is specifically designed with intentional flaws to provide practical manual and automated testing experience for QA students.
This plan details the testing scope, objectives, strategy, required test environments and tools, test data management, defect reporting standards, and the initial Jira project setup. It aims to ensure a systematic, effective, and educational testing process that thoroughly evaluates the application's quality and identifies all relevant defects, including the intentionally introduced ones.

Initial Project Setup Context:
As per the repository initialization, the project structure is established, a tests/ folder exists, and this initial test plan and strategy are being documented within test-plan.md. Team member roles and responsibilities, along with initial setup scripts and environment notes, are also being documented concurrently to ensure a smooth start to the QA efforts.
 2. Test Strategy
The testing strategy for the CleanCity application will adopt a hybrid approach, integrating both structured manual testing and progressive test automation. Given the application's unique purpose as a learning tool with deliberately introduced flaws, exploratory testing will be a crucial component to encourage deeper investigation and defect discovery.

Key Strategic Principles:
Risk-Based Prioritization: Testing efforts will be prioritized based on the criticality of application features, the potential impact of defects, and areas known or suspected to contain intentional flaws. Core functionalities, such as user authentication, user registration, and the waste pickup scheduling process, will receive the highest testing focus.
Agile Integration: Testing activities will be seamlessly integrated into the agile development sprints. QA team members will actively participate in all agile ceremonies, including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews, to ensure continuous testing from the earliest stages of development.
Traceability: A robust traceability matrix will be maintained to link all test cases directly to their corresponding requirements, user stories, or documented intentional flaws. This ensures comprehensive test coverage and clear accountability for verification.
Regression Focus: A strong emphasis will be placed on regression testing. As new features are developed and defects are fixed, automated regression tests will be the primary mechanism to ensure that existing functionalities remain stable and free from new regressions. Manual regression will supplement automation for areas not yet covered.
Learning & Discovery: Testers are explicitly encouraged to utilize exploratory testing techniques. This approach is vital for uncovering unexpected defects and for identifying and analyzing the "intentional flaws" embedded within the application, thereby enhancing the practical learning experience for QA students.
Continuous Feedback Loop: A clear and efficient feedback mechanism will be established between the development and QA teams to facilitate rapid defect resolution, foster collaboration, and promote continuous improvement of both the product and the development/testing processes.

3. Testing Scope and Objectives
This section clearly defines what will and will not be tested, and what the testing aims to achieve.
3.1. In-Scope Features/Functionalities:
    The following functional and non-functional aspects of the CleanCity web application are within the scope of this testing effort:

4. Test Environments and Tools
This section specifies the hardware, software, and tools required for testing.
4.1. Test Environments:
    A dedicated Staging/QA environment will serve as the primary testing ground, configured to closely mimic the anticipated production environment.
    Primary Testing Environment: Staging/QA Environment
        Client-Side Operating Systems:
             Windows 10/11 (latest stable versions)
        Web Browsers (latest stable versions):
             Google Chrome
             Mozilla Firefox
             Microsoft Edge
             Apple Safari
        Mobile Devices
             Android Smartphones 
           
        Backend & Database: The specific configurations (e.g., Node.js server, MongoDB database) for the QA environment will be provided and maintained by the development team, replicating the production setup. Environment notes will be maintained alongside initial setup scripts.
    Development Environments: Individual developer machines will be used for unit and component testing by developers.
    Production Environment: This environment will be used exclusively for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by stakeholders and will not be directly used for routine QA team testing.

4.2. Test Tools:
    A comprehensive suite of tools will be utilized to support various testing activities:
    Project Management & Defect Tracking:
        Jira: This will be the central platform for managing the entire project lifecycle, including requirements, user stories, tasks, and critically, all defect tracking and management.
    Test Case Management:
        Xray for Jira (Recommended Add-on): Integrated directly with Jira, Xray will be used for defining, organizing, executing, and reporting on test cases. It allows for linking tests to requirements, managing test cycles, and generating detailed test execution reports. (Alternatively, if Xray is not available, custom Jira issue types like "Test Case" and "Test Run" will be configured).
    Manual Testing Aids:
        Browser Developer Tools: (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools) Essential for inspecting HTML/CSS, monitoring network requests, viewing console logs for errors, and debugging JavaScript during manual testing.
        Postman / Insomnia: For performing API testing, validating backend endpoints, and potentially mocking external service responses.
        Screen Capture & Recording Tools: (e.g., ShareX, Snipping Tool, Loom, OBS Studio, built-in OS tools) to capture clear screenshots and video recordings for detailed defect documentation.
    Automated Testing Frameworks:
        UI/End-to-End (E2E) Testing:Playwright (chosen for its cross-browser capabilities, robust selectors, automatic waiting, and strong debugging features, which are highly beneficial for testing React applications and for QA students).
        API Testing:Jest (for unit and integration testing of JavaScript code) combined with Supertest (for making HTTP assertions against API endpoints).
        Programming Language: JavaScript / TypeScript (consistent with the React application).
    Version Control:
        Git: For managing all source code, test automation scripts, and test data in a centralized repository (GitHub, Bitbucket). The repository is already initialized with a tests/ folder.
    Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):
        GitHub Actions / Jenkins: To automate the execution of test suites (especially automated regression tests) upon code commits, pull requests, and on a scheduled basis, providing immediate feedback on code quality and preventing regressions. Initial setup scripts for CI/CD will be part of the documentation.

 5. Test Data Requirements
Careful planning and management of test data are critical for thorough and reproducible testing.
5.1. Test Data Generation Strategy:
    Initial Database Seeding: The development team will provide scripts (documented as initial setup scripts) to populate the QA environment's database with a diverse, realistic, and anonymized baseline dataset. This includes various user roles, pre-existing pickup requests, and geographical information relevant to Kenyan cities (e.g., Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu).
    Manual Data Creation: For specific, complex, or hard-to-automate scenarios, test data will be manually created directly through the application's User Interface (UI) or, if necessary, inserted directly into the database.
    Automated Test Data Generation: For automated test scripts, dynamic data generation will be leveraged using libraries such as Faker.js. This ensures unique data for each test run, preventing data conflicts and increasing test robustness.
    Pre-defined Datasets: Specific, reusable datasets ( CSV) for scenarios requiring consistent, predefined inputs will be maintained within the tests/data/ folder in the version control system.

5.2. Required Test Data Categories:
    User Accounts:
         Valid accounts for each role: Resident, Waste Collector, Admin (multiple accounts per role with varying attributes like location, contact info).
         Invalid accounts: Accounts with incorrect passwords, non-existent usernames/emails, or accounts in various states ( locked, unverified) for negative testing.
         Users from diverse simulated geographical regions within a Kenyan city context ( different estates, residential areas).
    Waste Pickup Requests:
         Requests in all possible statuses: Pending, Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled.
         Requests with different waste types (e.g., organic, recyclable, hazardous, mixed waste).
         Requests originating from various valid and invalid addresses/pickup locations within the simulated city ( residential, commercial, slum areas).
         Requests scheduled for different dates and times (past, present, future) to test scheduling logic.
         Requests with missing or invalid required data fields for input validation testing.
    Geographical Data: A representative set of valid and invalid addresses, districts, or zones within the simulated Kenyan city to test location-based functionalities.
    System Configuration Data: (If the application allows configuration) Data related to waste collection schedules, vehicle information, or specific city zones (specific dates for garbage collection in certain areas).

5.3. Test Data Management Practices:
    Version Control: All static test data files and data generation scripts will be stored and managed within the project's Git repository, specifically in the tests/data/ folder.
    Anonymization & Privacy: All test data will be anonymized or synthetic; no real personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data will be used.
    Clear Documentation: Each test data set will be clearly documented, explaining its purpose, the specific test scenarios it supports, and any expected outcomes. This documentation will reside alongside the test data.
    Environment Reset: The QA environment's database will be reset to a known baseline state before major test cycles or significant deployments to ensure test consistency and prevent data dependencies between test runs. Initial setup scripts will facilitate this.

 6. Defect Reporting Standards
A clear, consistent, and comprehensive approach to defect reporting is paramount for efficient communication between QA and development teams, leading to timely resolution. All identified defects will be tracked and managed within Jira.

6.1. Defect Lifecycle (Jira Workflow):
    The standard defect workflow within Jira for the CleanCity project will be as follows:

    New: The initial status of a newly reported defect.
    Open: The defect has been reviewed by the QA Lead or Product Owner, confirmed as valid, and assigned to a developer for investigation.
    In Progress: The assigned developer is actively working on implementing a fix for the defect.
    Resolved: The developer has implemented the fix and believes the defect is resolved. The issue is now ready for QA verification.
    Reopened: The QA team has retested the defect after it was marked "Resolved" but found that the issue still persists, or a new related issue has been introduced by the fix. The defect is sent back to the developer.
    Closed: The QA team has successfully verified the fix, and the defect is no longer reproducible. The functionality works as expected.
    Deferred: The defect is acknowledged as valid but is intentionally postponed to a future release due to lower priority, scope changes, or resource constraints.
    Rejected: The defect is deemed not to be a bug (e.g., works as designed, is a duplicate of an existing bug, is not reproducible, or is an invalid report).

6.2. Mandatory Fields for Defect Reports in Jira:
    To ensure clarity, reproducibility, and efficient triaging, every bug report in Jira must include the following mandatory information:

    Summary: A concise, clear, and descriptive title that summarizes the bug (e.g., "Login button inactive after 3 failed attempts," "Pickup request form does not submit when waste type is not selected").
    Description:
        Steps to Reproduce: A numbered, clear, and precise list of steps that can be followed to consistently reproduce the bug.
        Actual Results: A detailed description of what actually happened when following the steps.
        Expected Results: A clear definition of what should have happened according to the requirements or design.
        Observation: Any additional relevant details, context, or insights ("Observed in Chrome only," "Occurs intermittently").
    Environment:
        Browser (Name & Version): E.g., Chrome 126.0.0.0, Firefox 127.0.0.0.
        Operating System: Windows 10, 11 
        Device: Desktop, Samsung Galaxy.
        URL: The specific URL or page where the bug was observed.
        User Role: The specific user role used during testing ( Resident, Waste Collector, Admin).
    Severity: Reflects the impact of the bug on the application's functionality and user experience.
        Critical (P1): Application crash, data loss, blocks core business functionality, no workaround possible.
        Major (P2): Significant functionality broken, major usability issue, a workaround exists but is inconvenient.
        Minor (P3): Small functionality issue, UI glitch, inconsistent behavior, minor usability impact.
        Trivial (P4): Cosmetic issue (e.g., typo in non-critical text, minor alignment issue), easily ignored, no functional impact.
    Priority: Dictates the urgency with which the bug needs to be fixed.
        Highest: Must be fixed immediately; blocks further testing or release.
        High: Needs to be fixed in the current sprint/release.
        Medium: Should be fixed in the current or next sprint.
        Low: Can be fixed in a future sprint/release, non-critical.
  
    Assignee: The specific developer responsible for investigating and fixing the bug.
    Reporter: The QA team member who identified and reported the bug.
    Affected Version/Component: The specific application version (v1.0.0, v1.0.1-beta) and/or the affected component ("Authentication," "Scheduling Form," "Dashboard UI").
    Labels: Relevant tags for easier filtering, categorization, and reporting ( bug, frontend, backend, security, UI/UX, data-validation, intentional-flaw).
    Linked Issues: Links to related test cases, user stories, or other associated bugs to establish traceability.

6.3. Best Practices for Defect Reporting:
    Atomic: Each Jira issue should represent one distinct bug. If multiple issues are found, create separate tickets.
    Objective: Describe the bug factually, avoiding subjective language, assumptions about the cause, or blaming.
    Timely: Report bugs as soon as they are discovered to facilitate prompt investigation and resolution.
    Reproducibility: Ensure the steps to reproduce are exceptionally clear and consistent, enabling any team member (developer, other QA) to replicate the issue without ambiguity.

7. Jira Setup: CleanCity Project Configuration

A dedicated Jira project will be meticulously set up to manage all aspects of the CleanCity development and testing lifecycle, providing a centralized platform for collaboration and tracking.

7.1. Project Creation:
    Project Name: CleanCity: Waste Pickup Scheduler
    Project Key: CLEANCITY (A concise and unique identifier for the project)
    Project Type: Scrum (This type is ideal for supporting agile development practices, enabling sprint management, backlogs, and agile boards.)
    Project Lead/Administrator: [Designated Project Lead / Senior QA Engineer] - This individual will be responsible for the initial setup and ongoing administration of the Jira project.

7.2. Issue Types Configuration:
    The following issue types will be configured within the CleanCity Jira project to cover all development, testing, and project management needs:

    Standard Jira Issue Types:
        Epic: Used for high-level features or overarching themes that span multiple sprints ( "Implement User Authentication Module," "Develop Waste Pickup Scheduling Core").
        Story: Represents user-centric requirements or features that deliver value to the end-user (e.g., "As a Resident, I want to submit a waste pickup request," "As a Waste Collector, I can view my assigned pickups").
        Task: For general work items, technical tasks, or specific QA setup tasks that are not directly user stories (e.g., "Set up Playwright automation framework," "Create database seeding script," "Research optimal waste types").
        Bug: Specifically designated for tracking and managing all identified defects, errors, or flaws in the application
        Custom Issue Types (for Test Management - leveraging Xray for Jira):
        Test: This issue type, provided by Xray, will represent a single, executable test case. It will contain fields for preconditions, detailed test steps, and expected results.
        Test Set: An Xray issue type used to group related individual 'Tests' (test cases) for better organization ( "User Login Test Set," "Pickup Request Form Test Set").
        Test Plan: An Xray issue type used to define a collection of Test Sets for a specific testing phase or release ( "Sprint 1 Regression Test Plan," "Release 1.0 Acceptance Testing Plan").
        Test Execution: An Xray issue type that is automatically created when tests are executed from a Test Plan or Test Set. It tracks the actual execution results of individual tests (Passed, Failed, Skipped, Blocked) and allows linking to Bug issues.

7.3. Screen Schemes & Field Configuration Schemes:
    Screen Schemes: Configure distinct screens for each issue type to display only the most relevant fields. For example, the 'Bug' creation screen will prioritize "Summary," "Description," "Steps to Reproduce," "Environment," "Severity," and "Priority." The 'Test' issue type screen will include "Preconditions," "Test Steps," and "Expected Results."
    Field Configuration Schemes: Define which fields are mandatory, optional, or hidden for different issue types and contexts. This ensures that essential information is always captured while avoiding unnecessary clutter.

7.4. Permission Schemes:
    Roles: Establish clear user roles within Jira, such as Administrators, Developers, QA Team, Product Owners, and Stakeholders.
    Permissions: Define comprehensive permission schemes to control who can create, edit, transition, comment on, and view different issue types, ensuring appropriate access control and data security within the project.

7.6. Component Configuration:
    Components: Define logical components within the project to categorize issues and facilitate reporting and assignment. Examples include:
         Authentication & Authorization
         Resident Portal UI
         Waste Collector Portal UI
         Admin Dashboard UI
         Scheduling Logic (Backend)
         Notifications Service
         Database & API
         Reporting Module
     This structure helps in filtering issues, assigning them to relevant development teams or individuals, and generating focused reports.

7.7. Dashboard and Filters:
    CleanCity QA Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard will be created in Jira, populated with gadgets providing real-time visibility into key QA metrics. This includes:
         Open Bugs by Severity and Priority (pie chart).
         Bugs Reported vs. Resolved (trend graph).
         Test Execution Progress ( Xray gadget showing tests passed/failed/blocked for current Test Plan).
         Test Coverage (linking Stories to Tests via Xray).
         Bugs by Assignee (bar chart).
         Quick filters for "My Open Bugs," "Bugs for Current Sprint."
    JQL (Jira Query Language) Filters: A library of useful JQL filters will be developed for common queries, allowing quick access to specific data sets (e.g., type = Bug AND status in ("Open", "Reopened") ORDER BY priority DESC, type = Test AND "Test Status" = Failed AND "Test Plan" = "Release 1.0", component = "Authentication & Authorization" AND type = Bug).

## 13. Risks and Contingency Plan
This section identifies potential risks to the testing effort and outlines mitigation strategies.

Risk 1: Unstable Builds / Frequent Breaking Changes
    Likelihood: Medium (common in early development phases)
    Impact: High (delays testing, leads to rework)
    Mitigation Plan: Implement robust CI/CD with automated unit/integration tests; enforce code reviews; maintain strict definition of "Done" for development tasks; provide clear communication channels between Dev and QA.
    Contingency Plan: Allocate buffer time in sprint planning; prioritize critical path testing first; revert to previous stable builds if necessary.

Risk 2: Insufficient Test Data or Environment Stability
    Likelihood: Medium (especially with complex data requirements)
    Impact: High (blocks testing, leads to incomplete coverage)
    Mitigation Plan: Collaborate closely with Dev for database seeding scripts; define clear test data requirements upfront; establish a dedicated QA environment with regular maintenance.
    Contingency Plan: Manual data creation for blockers; use mocked services if external dependencies are unstable; escalate environment issues immediately.

Risk 3: Undocumented/Ambiguous Intentional Flaws
    Likelihood: Low (intentional flaws should be documented for learning)
    Impact: Medium (might be missed, or time wasted trying to reproduce "bugs" that are intentional features)
    Mitigation Plan: Maintain a clear, separate document ( Jira component) for intentional flaws, accessible to QA. Regular sync-ups between Dev and QA to discuss these.
    Contingency Plan: If a suspected intentional flaw is ambiguous, time-box investigation and consult with the development team for clarification.

Risk 4: Automation Script Flakiness / High Maintenance
    Likelihood: Medium (common with UI automation)
    Impact: Medium (reduces confidence in automation, increases manual effort)
    Mitigation Plan: Follow best practices for automation (e.g., explicit waits, robust selectors); conduct regular script reviews; dedicate time for automation maintenance each sprint.
    Contingency Plan: Prioritize fixing flaky tests; temporarily disable highly unstable tests and rely on manual testing if necessary; invest in better reporting for automation failures.

Risk 5: Resource Constraints / Lack of Specialized Skills
    Likelihood: Low (for QA students, learning is primary)
    Impact: Medium (limits testing depth/speed)
    Mitigation Plan: Cross-train QA team members; leverage external resources/tutorials for new tools/skills; allocate dedicated learning time.
    Contingency Plan: Focus on core functional testing first; defer non-critical non-functional testing; scale back automation goals if necessary.
